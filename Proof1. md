\section{Theorem 1: Dual Failure Law}

\begin{theorem}[Dual Failure Law]
Let $D(t), A(t) \in \mathbb{R}^n$ be continuously differentiable functions of time.
Define the misalignment vector
\[
E(t) = D(t) - A(t).
\]
Then for all $t$ such that $E(t) \neq 0$,
\[
\frac{d}{dt} \|E(t)\|
=
\frac{E(t)}{\|E(t)\|}
\cdot
\left( \dot D(t) - \dot A(t) \right).
\]
Consequently, the rate of change of misalignment magnitude decomposes uniquely
into domain drift and agent adaptation.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}

\textbf{Step 1: Norm Representation}

The Euclidean norm satisfies
\[
\|E(t)\| = \sqrt{E(t) \cdot E(t)}.
\]
Define
\[
\phi(t) = E(t) \cdot E(t).
\]
Then
\[
\|E(t)\| = \sqrt{\phi(t)}.
\]

\textbf{Step 2: Chain Rule}

Using the chain rule,
\[
\frac{d}{dt} \|E(t)\|
=
\frac{d}{dt} \sqrt{\phi(t)}
=
\frac{1}{2\sqrt{\phi(t)}} \, \phi'(t).
\]

\textbf{Step 3: Differentiate the Inner Product}

Since $\phi(t) = E(t) \cdot E(t)$, we apply the product rule:
\[
\phi'(t)
=
2 E(t) \cdot \dot E(t).
\]

Substituting,
\[
\frac{d}{dt} \|E(t)\|
=
\frac{1}{2\|E(t)\|} \cdot 2 E(t) \cdot \dot E(t).
\]

Canceling the factor of 2,
\[
\frac{d}{dt} \|E(t)\|
=
\frac{E(t) \cdot \dot E(t)}{\|E(t)\|}.
\]

\textbf{Step 4: Substitute Error Dynamics}

By definition,
\[
E(t) = D(t) - A(t).
\]
Differentiating,
\[
\dot E(t) = \dot D(t) - \dot A(t).
\]

Therefore,
\[
\frac{d}{dt} \|E(t)\|
=
\frac{E(t)}{\|E(t)\|}
\cdot
\left( \dot D(t) - \dot A(t) \right).
\]

\textbf{Step 5: Uniqueness of Decomposition}

Because differentiation in vector spaces is linear and unique,
\[
\dot E(t) = \dot D(t) - \dot A(t)
\]
admits no additional independent term.
Hence misalignment growth has exactly two generators:
domain drift $\dot D(t)$ and agent adaptation $\dot A(t)$.

\end{proof}
