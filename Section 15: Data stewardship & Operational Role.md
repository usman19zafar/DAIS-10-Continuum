15. Data Stewardship & Operational Roles
DAIS‑10 — Data Attribute Importance Standard
This section defines the roles, responsibilities, and operational structures required to implement, govern, and sustain DAIS‑10 across an organization.
DAIS‑10 is a meaning‑centric standard, and its effectiveness depends on clear ownership, accountable stewardship, and structured operational workflows.

The roles defined in this section ensure:

Consistent classification

Accurate scoring

Proper governance

Reliable enforcement

Complete auditability

Sustainable long‑term adoption

15.1 Stewardship Philosophy
DAIS‑10 stewardship is based on three principles:

1. Meaning Ownership
Every attribute must have a clearly identified owner responsible for its meaning, interpretation, and classification.

2. Governance Accountability
Governance teams ensure that DAIS‑10 rules are applied consistently and correctly.

3. Operational Execution
Engineering teams implement scoring, enforcement, and audit logic in production systems.

These three pillars ensure that DAIS‑10 remains stable, accurate, and compliant.

15.2 Core Roles
DAIS‑10 defines six primary roles:

Data Architect

Data Steward

Domain SME

Governance Lead

Engineering Lead

Audit & Compliance Reviewer

15.4 RACI Matrix
The following matrix defines responsibility distribution across roles.

Activity	Architect	Steward	SME	Governance	Engineering	Audit
Attribute Classification	C	R	A	I	I	I
Tier Assignment	A	R	C	I	I	I
Continuum Scoring	A	R	C	I	I	I
DIFS‑10 Fading	A	R	C	I	I	I
QFIM‑10 Interpretation	A	R	C	I	I	I
Governance Rules	C	I	I	A	C	I
Scoring Implementation	I	I	I	C	A	I
Enforcement Logic	I	I	I	C	A	I
Audit Logging	I	I	I	C	A	R
Certification	C	I	I	C	I	A
Legend:

R = Responsible

A = Accountable

C = Consulted

I = Informed

15.5 Operational Workflows
