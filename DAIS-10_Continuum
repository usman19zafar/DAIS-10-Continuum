DAIS‑10‑Continuum
Data Attribute Importance Standard — Powered by the Data Importance Fading System
Overview
DAIS‑10‑Continuum is the official repository for DAIS‑10, the Data Attribute Importance Standard.
This standard introduces a meaning‑centric, qualitative system for classifying data attributes based on their semantic importance, business utility, and analytical contribution.

Unlike traditional data quality frameworks that rely on rigid rules or binary validation, DAIS‑10 models attribute importance as a continuum. Meaning does not switch abruptly; it fades, blends, and transitions across overlapping zones. This fading behavior is governed by the Data Importance Fading System (DIFS‑10) and expressed through the Qualitative Fading Importance Model (QFIM‑10).

DAIS‑10‑Continuum provides the full specification, conceptual models, governance rules, scoring logic, SQL enforcement patterns, and expansion layers that make the standard reproducible, auditable, and infinitely extensible.

Core Components
DAIS‑10 — Data Attribute Importance Standard
The top‑level standard defining:

Essential, Contextual, and Enrichment zones

Overlapping transitional layers

Governance rules

Completeness scoring

Validation and enforcement expectations

Domain‑agnostic classification principles

DAIS‑10 is the structural backbone of the entire system.

DIFS‑10 — Data Importance Fading System
The behavioral engine that models how attribute importance fades across a semantic continuum.
DIFS‑10 enables:

Soft boundaries

Overlapping tiers

Gradual transitions

Context‑dependent importance shifts

It is the “physics” behind DAIS‑10.

QFIM‑10 — Qualitative Fading Importance Model
The interpretive model that describes how importance decays along the continuum.
QFIM‑10 defines:

Semantic gradients

Transitional zones (E–C, C–N, etc.)

Qualitative thresholds

Infinite‑depth classification layers

It transforms fading behavior into actionable tiering.

SICM‑10 — Semantic Importance Continuum Model
The conceptual model that maps attribute importance onto a 0–100 semantic scale.
It provides the mathematical and conceptual foundation for:

Tier boundaries

Overlap zones

Sub‑zones

Gradient scoring

MCM‑10 — Meaning‑Centric Model
The philosophical foundation of the standard.
It asserts that:

Meaning precedes mechanics

Semantic value determines importance

Business interpretation drives classification

This is the worldview behind DAIS‑10.

Why DAIS‑10‑Continuum Exists
Modern datasets contain attributes with vastly different levels of meaning and utility.
Yet most governance systems treat all attributes as equal.

DAIS‑10‑Continuum solves this by introducing:

A qualitative tiering system

A semantic continuum

A fading importance engine

Overlapping zones

Infinite‑depth expansion

This allows organizations to classify attributes with nuance, precision, and business alignment.
