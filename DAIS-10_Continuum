DAIS‑10 

DAIS‑10 (Data Attribute Importance Standard) is a meaning‑centric framework that classifies data attributes by their qualitative importance across a continuous, fading spectrum. It replaces rigid, binary validation with a semantic model that reflects how real‑world data meaning gradually transitions between essential, contextual, and enrichment roles.

DAIS‑10 provides organizations with a clear, executive‑level structure for understanding which attributes define a record’s identity, which enhance interpretation, and which add deeper analytical value. Built on the Data Importance Fading System (DIFS‑10) and the Qualitative Fading Importance Model (QFIM‑10), the standard introduces overlapping zones, semantic gradients, and tier‑weighted scoring that allow for nuanced governance and domain‑agnostic applicability.

Technically, DAIS‑10 maps attribute importance onto a 0–100 semantic continuum, enabling soft boundaries, dynamic importance shifts, and infinite‑depth classification. It defines the rules, scoring logic, SQL enforcement patterns, and governance structures required to operationalize attribute importance in modern data environments.

Designed for architects, analysts, and governance leaders, DAIS‑10 delivers a powerful, intuitive, and scalable way to understand data meaning. It elevates data quality from mechanical checks to semantic intelligence — helping organizations build cleaner models, stronger analytics, and more trustworthy decision systems.
