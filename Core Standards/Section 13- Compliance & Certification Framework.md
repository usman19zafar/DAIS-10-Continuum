13. Compliance & Certification Framework
DAIS‑10 — Data Attribute Importance Standard
The Compliance & Certification Framework defines how organizations demonstrate adherence to DAIS‑10.
It establishes the requirements, controls, evidence, and verification processes necessary to ensure that DAIS‑10 is implemented consistently, governed effectively, and auditable across all domains.

This framework applies to:

Data governance teams

Data stewards

Data architects

Engineering teams

Compliance and audit functions

External assessors

13.1 Purpose of the Compliance Framework
The purpose of the DAIS‑10 compliance framework is to:

Ensure consistent application of the standard

Provide audit‑ready evidence of classification and governance

Support regulatory alignment across industries

Enable certification of datasets, systems, and organizations

Maintain semantic integrity across implementations

Provide a repeatable assurance model

13.2 Compliance Levels
DAIS‑10 defines three levels of compliance, each representing increasing maturity and rigor.

Level 1 — Foundational Compliance
Attribute inventory completed

Tiers assigned

Continuum scores assigned

Basic governance rules applied

Level 2 — Operational Compliance
DIFS‑10 fading logic applied

QFIM‑10 qualitative interpretation applied

Scoring implemented in pipelines

SQL enforcement active

Audit logs maintained

Level 3 — Certified Compliance
Full governance integration

Domain adaptation documented

Annual review completed

External or internal certification audit passed

Evidence chain complete

13.3 Certification Types
DAIS‑10 supports three certification types:

13.3.1 Dataset Certification
Certification of a specific dataset, confirming:

All attributes classified

All tiers and scores assigned

Governance rules applied

Scoring and enforcement validated

13.3.2 System Certification
Certification of a system or platform, confirming:

DAIS‑10 logic embedded in pipelines

Enforcement rules implemented

Audit logging active

Governance workflows integrated

13.3.3 Organizational Certification
Certification of an entire organization, confirming:

Enterprise‑wide adoption

Governance maturity

Annual review processes

Domain adaptation frameworks

13.4 Compliance Requirements
To be considered compliant, an implementation must meet the following requirements:

13.4.1 Classification Requirements
All attributes classified using meaning roles

All tiers assigned

All continuum scores assigned

All rationales documented

13.4.2 Governance Requirements
Enforcement rules applied

Exception handling documented

Domain governance profile defined

Governance approvals recorded

13.4.3 Scoring Requirements
Weighting model implemented

Completeness scoring active

Thresholds documented

Scoring outputs logged

13.4.4 Audit Requirements
Evidence chain maintained

Audit logs complete

Reviewer identity recorded

Compliance reports generated

13.5 Evidence Requirements
Certification requires the following evidence:

13.5.1 Attribute Evidence
Attribute inventory

Tier assignments

Continuum scores

Rationale documentation

13.5.2 Governance Evidence
Enforcement rules

Exception logs

Domain adaptation documentation

13.5.3 Scoring Evidence
Weight tables

Completeness scores

Threshold definitions

13.5.4 Audit Evidence
Audit logs

Reviewer notes

Compliance reports

13.6 Certification Process
The certification process follows a five‑step workflow:

Step 1 — Submission
Organization submits:

Attribute inventory

Classification outputs

Governance rules

Scoring logic

Audit logs

Step 2 — Review
DAIS‑10 assessors review:

Tiering accuracy

Continuum scoring

Governance alignment

Scoring implementation

Audit completeness

Step 3 — Verification
Assessors verify:

Evidence chain

Enforcement rules

Domain adaptation

Exception handling

Step 4 — Approval
Certification is approved if:

All requirements met

No critical gaps

All evidence validated

Step 5 — Issuance
A certification report is issued with:

Certification level

Scope

Validity period

Conditions

Recommendations

13.7 Certification Validity & Renewal
Validity Period
Certification is valid for 12 months.

Renewal Requirements
Annual review completed

Updated evidence submitted

Changes documented

Exceptions resolved

Suspension or Revocation
Certification may be suspended if:

Governance rules not followed

Scoring logic disabled

Evidence incomplete

Critical exceptions unaddressed

13.8 Compliance Monitoring
Organizations must maintain:

Continuous audit logging

Quarterly governance reviews

Exception tracking

Scoring accuracy checks

Domain adaptation updates

Monitoring ensures ongoing compliance between certification cycles.

13.9 Non‑Compliance Categories
DAIS‑10 defines three categories of non‑compliance:

Minor Non‑Compliance
Missing documentation

Minor scoring inconsistencies

Non‑critical governance gaps

Moderate Non‑Compliance
Missing rationales

Incorrect tier assignments

Incomplete audit logs

Critical Non‑Compliance
Essential attributes missing

Enforcement disabled

Scoring logic incorrect

Evidence chain broken

Critical non‑compliance requires immediate remediation.

13.10 Compliance Checklist
